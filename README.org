Shentong is a Haskell implementation of [[http://www.shenlanguage.org][Shen]], a modern Lisp family
programming language which includes many advanced and interesting
features. The name is thematically in keeping with that of /shen/, a
construct from an other esoteric religion.

Package dependencies are:

+ mtl
+ attoparsec
+ unordered-containers
+ uniplate
+ findbin
+ hashmap

.. some of which may be in the most recent Haskell Platform
release. If not, they can be installed with cabal. findbin needs to be
installed with cabal.

An important note: the K Lambda directory must be included in the
same directory as the Shen[.exe] executable, if one is
produced. Until the raw K Lambda code is converted to Haskell and
compiled as another module in the program, this is essential.
