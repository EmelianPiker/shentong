* A Haskell implementation of the Shen programming language

Shentong is a Haskell implementation of [[http://www.shenlanguage.org][Shen]], a modern Lisp family
programming language which includes many advanced and interesting
features. The name is thematically in keeping with that of /shen/, a
construct from an other esoteric religion.

It takes about 4-5 seconds for the compiled implementation to load on
my machine. The codensity transformation was applied to the KLContext
state transformer, and consequently, the new implementation is
approximately twice as fast as the first, unoptimized release. I base
this on the observation that the Shen test suite now takes ~ 170 seconds
to run to completion, an improvement over the earlier ~ 340
seconds. 

Package dependencies are:

*mtl*
*attoparsec*
*unordered-containers*
*uniplate*
*findbin*

.. some of which may be in the most recent Haskell Platform
release. If not, they can be installed with cabal. findbin needs to be
installed with cabal.

An important note: the K Lambda directory must be included in the
same directory as the Shen[.exe] executable, if one is
produced. Until the raw K Lambda code is converted to Haskell and
compiled as another module in the program, this is essential.
