Shentong is a Haskell implementation of Shen, a modern Lisp family
programming language which includes many advanced and interesting
features. The name is thematically in keeping with that of _shen_, a
construct from an other esoteric religion.

It takes about 7 seconds for the compiled implementation to load on my
machine. The code hasn't been subjected to any optimization or
profiling as of yet. It could probably benefit from enhancements in a
few areas, ie. unrolling monad transformer stacks. It does pass the
full suite of Test Programs included in the Shen sources.

Package dependencies are:

mtl
attoparsec
unordered-containers
findbin
uniplate

.. some of which may be in the most recent Haskell Platform
release. If not, they can be installed with cabal. findbin needs to be
installed with cabal.
